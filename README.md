# Turtoise-Commands

List of commands used for  the bot - turtoise 


definition of the bot:

This bot is mainly used for education information and fun all based around tortoises and turtles. The bot uses twitters API to post updates on twitter accounts based around informing their followers about the importance of keeping sea turtles from being  endangered and eventually become extinct,  from pollution and global warming. There are also a few commands to improve user experience on twitch.

-bttv (displays all bettertwitchtv emotes)

-ffz (displays all frankerfacez emotes)

-apod (Astronomy Picture Of The Day)
One of the most popular websites at NASA is the Astronomy Picture of the Day. In fact, this website is one of the most popular websites across all federal agencies. It has the popular appeal of a Justin Bieber video. This endpoint structures the APOD imagery and associated metadata so that it can be repurposed for other applications. In addition, if the concept_tags parameter is set to True, then keywords derived from the image explanation are returned. These keywords could be used as auto-generated hashtags for twitter or instagram feeds; but generally help with discoverability of relevant imagery.
The full documentation for this API can be found in the APOD API Github repository.

Customised timers and commands can also be made by contacting @turtoise, they need to be within the tos.
